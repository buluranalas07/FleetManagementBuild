#Real-Time Monitoring System for Fuel Theft Detection with GPS Tracking for Land-Based Trucks

This project is a Fuel Theft Detection system with real-time fuel monitoring and GPS tracking for land-based trucks. It was developed as part of our BSCS Thesis and was awarded the Most Innovative Project and Study. The system uses a combination of hardware and software to monitor fuel levels, track locations, and detect any theft.
